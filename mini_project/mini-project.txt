You will write a program that keeps track of a baseball team stored in a .CSV file.
The user will have options to add, edit and remove a player.
The user will be able to edit the player name, jersey number, at bats, and hits.
The user will be able to view the entire team in a nicely formatted way.
The team view will also include the hitting percentage, which you will calculate (hits/atbats), rounded to 3 places.
The team view will also include a number (1,2,3 etc.) for each player so that the user can pick a certain player to edit.
The user will always be presented the team listing above the command input. 
Every time the user adds, edits or deletes a player, the file should be updated.
You can store the data as a List of Dictionaries. Or whatever you prefer. Sample code is provided.
You should likely create functions to read the data, write the data, edit a player, delete a player, add a player, and display all of the players.
